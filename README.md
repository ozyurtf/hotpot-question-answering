### HOTPOT QA

In the current Question Answering applications, the answers generally can be able to found in a specific part of the context without reasoning. There is no need to make inference and look at different parts of the text to reach an answer. It is clear that this is not the case in our daily lives. When we try to find an answer to a question, the answers may not be found in the context directly and we may need to look at different parts of the text and make some kind of inference. And this is where traditional Question Answering methods are stuck. 

In this project, the main goal is to develop a method that can be able to make inference and reasoning when required to be able to find the answer of the question in the context. Because there are some ready-to-use datasets that can be used for this goal, data preparation step is skipped. The data that is used in this project is HotpotQA because of three reasons: 

1) It was prepared to test the systems' ability to make reasoning and inference in a large context. 
2) It is quite diverse and relatively large dataset. 
3) It includes the supporting facts, in other words, sub-texts that lead to the answers. The supporting facts help the model to make inference and reasoning.
